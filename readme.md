# Nozomi

Nozomi is a collection of Python protocols that, when implemented, give life to a web application or HTTP Application Programming Interface (API).

## State of play

Nozomi is a distillation of concepts developed in the production of the Amatino API and web application. It is a work in progress, and should not yet be used by anyone for anything.
